# BankAutomation

In an agile environment, developers emphasize pushing changes quickly. With every change that requires a modification to the front end, they need to run appropriate cross browser tests. While a small project may choose manual testing, an increasing number of browsers make a case for automation testing.
Therefore we create the project to do automated tests for the bank which can bring us three main benefits.

- Accelerated Results: Owing to the quick implementation of automated testing, plenty of time is saved even for systems. 
- Reduced Expenses: It is of no surprise that, while the initial investment may be on the higher side, automated testing saves lots of expenses.
- Testing Efficiency Improvement: Automated tests eventually take up significantly lesser amount of time. They can be run virtually unattended, leaving the results to be monitored towards the end of the process.

## Tool
- Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is one of the most popular tools for Web UI Automation. It allows you to define tests and automatically detect results of these tests on a browser. 
- Python 3.7.2
